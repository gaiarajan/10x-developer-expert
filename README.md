# The Mythology of the Expert

The inclusion gap impacts [which algorithms we build](https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai), [how they're used](https://points.datasociety.net/dont-call-ai-magic-142da16db408), and [how they affect user communities](https://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/439/641). It dictates [what training data is used](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016?s=20), and [how](https://xkcd.com/1838/). It asserts itself in [every facet of UX](https://uxdesign.cc/diversity-and-inclusion-are-critical-in-design-60fc4a5abb4a?gi=4a084f5c38d5). Though it's too often essentialized to "*more girls in STEM*," further exploration of this issue reveals it as stark, pervasive, and deserving of far more nuance and sincere action. 

In this post, I will interrogate one facet of development culture that I believe contributes to the inclusion gap. This post will be a three-segment exploration into the mythology of the expert, its philosophical grounding, and its effects. It will use concepts from critical theory, machine learning fairness, and other fields, and I will do my best to fill in context and add further resources wherever possible.

## Part 1: Introducing the Mythology

If you're a developer, or connected at all to the software community, chances are you've heard of the *[10x developer](https://blog.codegiant.io/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer-492fa3f57101?gi=292c35358684)*— a mythical unicorn developer who achieves perfect productivity and flawless code, all in half the record time. He (and he's *usually* a he) is a paragon of expertise. He's the subject of an entire mythology. He also doesn't exist.

In this part of a three-part series, I'll be unpacking the role of the mythology of "expertise," its effects, and what it means for open source culture. Let's begin. First, a definition: when I speak of 'mythology,' I don't mean that the "expert" is a myth (though he does sometimes seem magical!). I am speaking of the culture and aura that surrounds the expert and gives him a position of power. 

In this series, I'll posit that **expertise is less a meritocracy and more a social category**. Therefore, the socialization of certain groups primes them to inhabit the role of expert, and replicates itself within teams, online environments, and movements[1]. "Experts" who fit the social category and are able to adequately perform then rise to prominence, and are rewarded with confirmation of their expertise by the group. 


In open-source movements, this presents as a hierarchy of users and corresponding contributions. For example, in mostly-volunteer open source projects, studies have shown that women perform mostly non-code contributions, while men contribute primarily with code[2]. This performance of expertise leads marginalized individuals to abdicate their claim to expertise subconsciously. When "expert" is a social shorthand for cisgender, heterosexual white male, it can be difficult for marginalized contributors to assert expertise. 

Expert systems encourage developers to prize the social qualities of 'expert' groups. This encourages a complete "dissociation" into rationality, as Alison Adam puts it in her book, The Thinking Machine [3]. **It also encourages developers— even outside the community— to perform these stereotypical traits.** In a 2017 survey by GitHub, 50% of 5,500 respondents answered that they had witnessed toxic interactions while working on open-source projects. Almost half had encountered rudeness, and 11% had encountered stereotyping of marginalized groups [4]. The performance of expertise necessitates 'othering' in service of the main group, as in Hegel's master-slave dialectic[5]. In Hegel's idea, a social identity is formed through the othering of individuals not oneself. Authority is formed through performance. 

**In short, "expert" is not an unpolitical term.** The paradigm of the 10% developer is a reflection of a culture that prizes socialization and performance of merit above cooperation, democracy, and inclusion. 

I will also extend this to apply to machines. By prizing lack of cooperation and aloof expertise, we prioritize applications and initiatives that also perform authority. A common example: depictions of technology often invoke "magic," directing accountability away from developers and performing unreachable expertise[6]. The influence of the mythology of expertise is pervasive, and has huge consequences. **Developers and applications who possess the social power of expertise are trusted without question, leading to a lack of focus on ethics and accountability for the consequences of technology on marginalized groups.** (Check out [AwfulAI](https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai) for examples!)

In Part 2, we'll be delving deeper into the mythology of the expert and exploring ways to dismantle this structure for greater inclusion and a healthier community. 

## Part 2: Machines, Magic, and Messaging

For many other fields, expertise can be confirmed through board exams, a plethora of tests, and official approval. In contrast, open-source prides itself on being available to all, eschewing official identifiers of skill in favor of community vetting. In theory, this should lead to a more inclusive development environment. So [why is the open-source inclusion gap usually even greater than the corresponding gap in the workforce](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/)? 

The mythology of expertise is one important reason. Though cishet white men are often encouraged to inhabit the role of 'expert', marginalized people are subjected to a sort of enforced uncertainty. Women [have been shown to perform uncertainty](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/) even when sure, meaning that, even when completely qualified, they may be less comfortable reaching out to strangers or correcting those who identify as experts. These two skills are integral to open-source contributions.

So how do we democratize expertise? How do we encourage marginalized people (who may not have been socialized to inhabit this category) to see themselves as capable?

First, **make sure programs for career development for marginalized people do not only include skill development.** [Studies have shown](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/105268461102100405) that educators and mentors may possess the skills to merit "expertise," but if they suffer from impostor syndrome or don't accept a position of relational authority, they may pass these issues on to their students. Mentorship from marginalized educators who've worked through the barriers of expertise can help aspiring professionals enter the world of development easier. 

Second, **allow for uncertainty. Celebrate mistakes.** It may be tempting to value "progress" above else, especially when working with strangers. But moving away from the stereotypical traits of an expert— brashness, certainty— will allow more perspectives into our work and foster a truly open open-source movement.

And third, **be aware of these systemic inequities.** Work to make projects and teams welcoming to qualified contributors, and realize that the mythology of expertise is a pervasive problem *everywhere.* 

The inclusion gap certainly has many contributing factors, but one important one is the distribution of assumed "expertise": implementing these tools, and de-emphasizing expert positionality, can help make our environments more inclusive, rich, and interesting.
