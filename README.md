# The Mythology of the Expert

The inclusion gap impacts [which algorithms we build](https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai), [how they're used](https://points.datasociety.net/dont-call-ai-magic-142da16db408), and [how they affect user communities](https://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/439/641). It dictates [what training data is used](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016?s=20), and [how](https://xkcd.com/1838/). It asserts itself in [every facet of UX](https://uxdesign.cc/diversity-and-inclusion-are-critical-in-design-60fc4a5abb4a?gi=4a084f5c38d5). Though it's too often essentialized to "*more girls in STEM*," further exploration of this issue reveals it as stark, pervasive, and deserving of far more nuance and sincere action. 

In this post, I will interrogate one facet of development culture that I believe contributes to the inclusion gap. This post will be a three-segment exploration into the mythology of the expert, its philosophical grounding, and its effects. It will use concepts from critical theory, machine learning fairness, and other fields, and I will do my best to fill in context and add further resources wherever possible.

## Part 1: Introducing the Mythology

If you're a developer, or connected at all to the software community, chances are you've heard of the *[10x developer](https://blog.codegiant.io/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer-492fa3f57101?gi=292c35358684)*— a mythical unicorn developer who achieves perfect productivity and flawless code, all in half the record time. He (and he's *usually* a he) is a paragon of expertise. He's the subject of an entire mythology. He also doesn't exist.

In this part of a three-part series, I'll be unpacking the role of the mythology of "expertise," its effects, and what it means for open source culture. Let's begin. First, a definition: when I speak of 'mythology,' I don't mean that the "expert" is a myth (though he does sometimes seem magical!). I am speaking of the culture and aura that surrounds the expert and gives him a position of power within the culture. 

In this series, I'll posit that **expertise is less a meritocracy and more a social category**. Therefore, the socialization of certain groups primes them to inhabit the role of expert, and replicates itself within teams, online environments, and movements[1]. "Experts" who fit the social category and are able to adequately perform then rise to prominence, and are rewarded with confirmation of their expertise by the group. 

In open-source movements, this presents as a hierarchy of users and corresponding contributions. For example, in mostly-volunteer open source projects, studies have shown that women perform mostly non-code contributions, while men contribute primarily with code[2]. This performance of expertise leads marginalized individuals to abdicate their claim to expertise subconsciously. When "expert" is a social shorthand for cisgender, heterosexual white male, it can be difficult for marginalized contributors to assert expertise. 

Expert systems encourage developers to prize the social qualities of 'expert' groups. This encourages a complete "dissociation" into rationality, as Alison Adam puts it in her book, The Thinking Machine [3]. **It also encourages developers— even outside the community— to perform these stereotypical traits.** In a 2017 survey by GitHub, 50% of 5,500 respondents answered that they had witnessed toxic interactions while working on open-source projects. Almost half had encountered rudeness, and 11% had encountered stereotyping of marginalized groups [4]. The performance of expertise necessitates 'othering' in service of the main group, as in Hegel's master-slave dialectic[5]. In Hegel's idea, a social identity is formed through the othering of individuals not oneself. Authority is formed through performance. 

**In short, "expert" is not an unpolitical term.** The paradigm of the 10% developer is a reflection of a culture that prizes socialization and performance of merit above cooperation, democracy, and inclusion. 

I will also extend this to apply to machines. By prizing lack of cooperation and aloof expertise, we prioritize applications and initiatives that also perform authority. A common example: depictions of technology often invoke "magic," directing accountability away from developers and performing unreachable expertise[6]. The influence of the mythology of expertise is pervasive, and has huge consequences. **Developers and applications who possess the social power of expertise are trusted without question, leading to a lack of focus on ethics and accountability for the consequences of technology on marginalized groups.** (Check out [AwfulAI](https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai) for examples!)

In Part 2, we'll be delving deeper into the mythology of the expert and exploring ways to dismantle this structure for greater inclusion and a healthier community.
